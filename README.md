EDX C# DEV204x Assignments

Since the peer review feature on EDX is of now fairly limited, i.e. lacks proper formatting that has a bad effect on readability, imposes limits on feedback, etc. I've created this repository to share code for review in readable format and simple to provide feedback on.

Feel free to comment, contribute, share with your classmates if you want to. However, I plead that you don't just blindly copy the code from this repository to complete assignments for the sake of appearance, but actually learn from it, where it applies.
